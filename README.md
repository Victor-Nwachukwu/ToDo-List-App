ToDo List App - Project Plan
Project Title & Description
Project Title: TaskFlow - Modern ToDo List Application

What I'm Building:
A responsive, modern ToDo list application that allows users to create, organize, and track their tasks efficiently. The app will include features like task categorization, due dates, priority levels, and filtering options.

Who It's For:
This application is designed for anyone needing to organize their daily tasks, from students managing assignments to professionals tracking work projects. It's for users who want a clean, intuitive interface without unnecessary complexity.

Why It Matters:
Effective task management is crucial for productivity and mental clarity. This app provides a simple yet powerful solution that helps users focus on what matters most, reducing the cognitive load of keeping track of responsibilities.

Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: React 18

Language: JavaScript (ES6+)

Build Tool: Vite (for faster development and building)

Compiler: Babel (via Vite)

Styling: TailwindCSS

State Management: React Context API or Zustand (lightweight alternative)

Icons: React Icons library

Date Handling: date-fns library

Local Storage: For data persistence

Testing: Jest and React Testing Library

Linting: ESLint with Airbnb config

Formatting: Prettier

AI Integration Strategy
Code Generation
I will use GitHub Copilot or Claude Code in my IDE (VS Code) to:

Scaffold React components with proper structure and PropTypes

Generate boilerplate code for context providers, custom hooks, and utility functions

Create initial TailwindCSS class combinations for UI elements

Suggest efficient algorithms for task filtering and sorting

Example prompts:

"Create a React component for a task item with checkbox, text, and delete button using TailwindCSS"

"Generate a custom hook for localStorage persistence for todo items"

"Write a function to filter tasks by status and category"

Testing
I will use AI tools to:

Generate unit test templates for React components with specific test cases

Create integration tests for user flows (adding, completing, deleting tasks)

Suggest edge cases and error scenarios to test

Example testing prompts:

"Write Jest tests for a TodoItem component that verifies the checkbox toggle functionality"

"Generate test cases for the task filtering function covering all possible filter combinations"

"Create integration tests for adding a new task and verifying it appears in the list"

Documentation
I will leverage AI to:

Write comprehensive JSDoc comments for functions and components

Generate descriptive propTypes definitions

Maintain consistent documentation style across the codebase

Create this README and update it as the project evolves

Example documentation prompts:

"Write JSDoc comments for this task filtering function explaining parameters and return value"

"Generate PropTypes for the TaskForm component with all required props"

"Create documentation for the custom useLocalStorage hook"

Context-Aware Techniques
I will implement these strategies:

Provide AI tools with the project file structure to maintain consistency

Share API specifications (for local storage data structure) to ensure generated code follows the correct patterns

Feed component dependencies to AI when requesting new code to ensure proper integration

Use diff-aware prompts when modifying existing code to maintain consistency

Example context-aware prompts:

"Given my existing TaskContext component structure, create a function to update task priority"

"Based on my current task object structure {id, text, completed, dueDate, priority}, create a function to sort tasks by due date"

"Here's my current file tree [provide tree], suggest the best location for a new task statistics component"

Implementation Phases
Setup Phase

Initialize React app with Vite

Configure TailwindCSS

Set up linting and formatting

Create basic project structure

Core functionality

Implement task creation, reading, updating, and deletion

Add local storage persistence

Create basic UI components

Enhanced features

Implement filtering and sorting

Add task categories and priorities

Include due dates and reminders

UI/UX polish

Responsive design improvements

Animations and transitions

Accessibility enhancements

Testing and documentation

Write comprehensive test suite

Complete code documentation

Final README and deployment instructions

Getting Started
After project initialization, development can begin with:

npm install to install dependencies

npm run dev to start development server

npm run test to run tests

npm run build to create production build

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing a modern ToDo list application while effectively integrating AI tools throughout the development process.
